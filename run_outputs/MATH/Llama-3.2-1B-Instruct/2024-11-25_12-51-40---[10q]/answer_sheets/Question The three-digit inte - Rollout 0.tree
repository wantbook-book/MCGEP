[U-0: Q: 0.0; N: 1; V: None; UCT: 666] User: The three-digit integer $63\underline{\hphantom{0}}$ is a multiple of 3. What is the greatest possible difference between two of the possibilities for the units digit?
                                       Ground truth: 9
----[TS-1: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: A number is a multiple of 3 if the sum of its digits is also a multiple of 3.
----[TS-2: Q: 0.0; N: 1; V: None; UCT: 0.0] OST: A number is a multiple of 3 if it is also a multiple of 9. This means that the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3.
--------[TS-9: Q: 0.0; N: 1; V: None; UCT: 0.0] OST: Let's consider each possibility for the units digit in $\underline{\hphantom{0}}$. There are five possibilities: 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12.
------------[TS-13: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: For each possibility, calculate the sum of the digits of the corresponding value in $63\underline{\hphantom{0}}$: $63+0=63$, $63+3=66$, $63+6=69$, $63+9=72$, and $63+12=75$.
------------[TS-14: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: To determine whether a number is a multiple of 9, we need to check if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. If the units digit is 0, then the sum of the other two digits is a multiple of 9 as well. For example, $36$, $45$, and $54$ are multiples of 3 but not multiples of 9.
------------[TS-15: Q: 0.0; N: 1; V: None; UCT: 0.0] OST: We know that the first digit cannot be 0 since the original number would not be a three-digit integer. Therefore, we have four options for the first digit and five options for the second digit. To maximize the difference between any two possibilities, we choose the largest possible value for the units digit, which is 9.
----------------[TS-17: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: Therefore, the greatest possible difference between two of the possibilities for the units digit is $9 - 0 = 9$ or $9 - 3 = 6$, or $9 - 6 = 3$ or $9 - 12 = -3$.
----------------[TS-18: Q: 0.0; N: 1; V: None; UCT: 0.0] OST: We now calculate the greatest possible difference between any two possibilities for the units digit, considering that the other two digits are 6.
--------------------[TS-21: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: This gives us $|9-6|=3$. Therefore, the greatest possible difference between two of the possibilities for the units digit is 3.
--------------------[TS-22: Q: 0.0; N: 1; V: None; UCT: 0.0] OST: When the units digit is 9, the remaining digits are 6. Therefore, the greatest possible difference between any two possibilities for the units digit is $|9 - 6| = \boxed{3}$.
--------------------[TS-23: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: If we select the smallest possible value for the tens digit, i.e., 0, we get a corresponding 72 as one of the possibilities.
--------------------[[(T) DA-24: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.19; UCT: 999]] Ans: Now that we know the value of the units digit is 9, we can substitute it into our equation for the sum of the digits being a multiple of 3: $$6 + 9 + \text{units digit} = 15 + \text{units digit}.$$ Solving for the units digit, we get $$\text{units digit} = 15 - 6 = 9.$$

Since the units digit was 9, the next highest value for the units digit would be 6, so the greatest possible difference between any two possibilities for the units digit is 9-6=3.

Therefore, the greatest possible difference between two of the possibilities for the units digit is 3. The answer is: 3.
----------------[TS-19: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: Now we calculate the differences between the other two possibilities. If the units digit is 0, then the first digit is 6 and the second digit is 3; therefore, the difference is 3. If the units digit is 3, then the first digit is 6 and the second digit is 0; therefore, the difference is 3. If the units digit is 6, then the first digit is 7 and the second digit is 0; therefore, the difference is 1. If the units digit is 9, then the first digit is 7 and the second digit is 0; therefore, the difference is 1.
----------------[(T) DA-20: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.19; UCT: 999] Ans: Now let's calculate the differences between pairs of possibilities for the units digit. If the units digit is 9, the other possibilities are 0, 3, and 6. However, if the units digit is 0, the other possibilities are 3 and 6. Therefore, the greatest possible difference between two possibilities for the units digit is $|9-0|=9$, so the answer is 9. The answer is: 9.
------------[(T) DA-16: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.19; UCT: 999] Ans: We need to find the greatest difference between two possibilities. To do so, let's first list the possibilities for the units digit: $0$, $3$, $6$, $9$, and $12$. Now, let's examine the differences between pairs of these possibilities:

*   $|0 - 3| = 3$
*   $|0 - 6| = 6$
*   $|0 - 9| = 9$
*   $|0 - 12| = 12$
*   $|3 - 6| = 3$
*   $|3 - 9| = 6$
*   $|3 - 12| = 9$
*   $|6 - 9| = 3$
*   $|6 - 12| = 6$
*   $|9 - 12| = 3$

Based on the calculations above, the greatest difference occurs when the units digit is 9, resulting in a difference of $9$. Therefore, the greatest possible difference between two of the possibilities for the units digit is $\boxed{9}$. The answer is: 9.
--------[TS-10: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: Let $x$ be the missing digit. For the number $63\underline{x}$ to be a multiple of 9, the sum of its digits, including $x$, must be a multiple of 9.
--------[TS-11: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: Let the units digit be $d$. Then, the sum of the hundreds and tens digits is $63+d$, and since this must be a multiple of 9, we know that $63+d=18+k$ for some non-negative integer $k$.
--------[(T) DA-12: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.12; UCT: 999] Ans: To start, let's list the multiples of 3 between 60 and 90: 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90. From these numbers, we see that the possible possibilities for the units digit are 6, 9, and 0. To find the greatest possible difference, we need to compare each pair of these numbers. Let's calculate the differences:

*   6 - 0 = 6
*   9 - 6 = 3
*   0 - 9 = -9

Therefore, the greatest possible difference between two of the possibilities for the units digit is 9. The answer is: \boxed{9}.
----[TS-3: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: To determine which units digits make $63\underline{\hphantom{0}}$ a multiple of 3, we need to use the divisibility rule of 3.
----[(T) DA-4: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.19; UCT: 999] Ans: To determine the units digits that make the number $63\underline{\hphantom{0}}$ a multiple of 3, we need to consider the properties of multiples of 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3. Thus, the sum of the digits $6$, $3$, and the units digit $\underline{\hphantom{0}}$ must be a multiple of 3. The possible sums of digits are 9, 12, 15, etc., and these require the units digit to be 3, 6, or 9. Therefore, the greatest possible difference between two of the possibilities for the units digit is $\boxed{6-3=3}$. The answer is: 3.
----[SQ-5: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.8; UCT: 999] Q: What is the sum of the digits in the expression $63\underline{\hphantom{0}}$?
                                           A: The sum of the digits is $6+3=9$. The answer is 9.
----[SQ-6: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.4; UCT: 999] Q: What is the condition under which the number $63\underline{\hphantom{0}}$ is divisible by 3?
                                           A: In order for $63\underline{\hphantom{0}}$ to be divisible by 3, its units digit must be either 0 or 3. The answer is 0 or 3.
----[SQ-7: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.3; UCT: 999] Q: What are all possible values for the units digit when $63\underline{\hphantom{0}}$ is a multiple of 3?
                                           A: Since $63\underline{\hphantom{0}}$ must be divisible by 3, the possible values for the units digit are 0, 3, and 6. The answer is 0, 3, or 6.
