[U-0: Q: 0.34; N: 1; V: None; UCT: 666] User: Compute $\arccos (\cos 7).$  All functions are in radians.
                                        Ground truth: 7 - 2 \pi
----[TS-1: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: Let $\theta=7.$
----[TS-2: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: Recall the relationship between cosine and arccosine: $$\arccos (\cos \theta )= \theta.$$
----[TS-3: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: Recall that the cosine function returns values between -1 and 1. Thus, any value of cosine for which $\cos x = -1$ or $\cos x = 1$ corresponds to an angle whose measure is one radian.
----[[(T) DA-4: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.16; UCT: 999]] Ans: Let's think step by step. Recall that $\arccos(x)$ is the inverse function of $\cos(x)$. So, $\arccos(\cos(7))=7.$ Therefore, the value of $\arccos(\cos(7))$ is $7$. The answer is: 7.
----[SQ-5: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.1; UCT: 999] Q: What is the cosine of 7 radians?
                                           A: $\cos (7)$ is approximately equal to $0.99325$. The answer is $\cos 7$.
----[SQ-6: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.1; UCT: 999] Q: Recall the definition of arccosine.
                                           A: By definition, $\arccos (\cos \theta) = \theta$ if $\cos \theta \ge 0,$ and $\arccos (\cos \theta) = \pi - \theta$ if $\cos \theta < 0.$
----[SQ-7: Q: 0.34; N: 1; V: 0.1; UCT: 0.34] Q: Let's denote $\cos 7$ as $x$, so that $\arccos (x) = 7.$ Then what is the function that takes its input as the cosine of some angle, and outputs $7.$
                                             A: This function is simply the inverse of the cosine function itself.
--------[TS-9: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: Recall the definition of the inverse cosine function: $\arccos(\theta)=\theta^{-1}$.
--------[TS-10: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: Recall that $\arccos x$ returns the angle whose cosine is $x$, measured counterclockwise from the point $(1,0)$ in the unit circle.
--------[TS-11: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: Using the identity $\cos(\theta)=\sin(\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta),$ we rewrite $\cos 7$ as $\sin\left(45^\circ - 7^\circ\right)=\sin\left(38^\circ\right)$ using the angle subtraction formula for sine.
--------[(T) DA-12: Q: 0.34; N: 1; V: 0.34; UCT: 0.34] Ans: Since $\arccos(\cos x)=x,$ if $\arccos(x)=7$, then $x=7$. Therefore, the value of the given function is 7. The answer is: 7.
--------[SQ-13: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.1; UCT: 999] Q: How does this function work?
                                                A: When you input a real number into this function, it will return an angle whose cosine is equal to the given number.
--------[SQ-14: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.2; UCT: 999] Q: So what does this look like mathematically?
                                                A: Mathematically, this function looks like $y = x.$ The answer is $y = x.$
--------[SQ-15: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.1; UCT: 999] Q: So, what is the graph of this inverse function?  It would have its domain restricted to $[-1, 1],$ since that's where the cosines lie.
                                                A: In other words, it would be the line $y = 7.$
--------[RS-16: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.3; UCT: 999] Re-Ans: To compute $\arccos (\cos 7),$ we use the relationship $\cos(\theta)=\pm \sqrt{\frac{1+\cos(2\theta)}{2}},$ where $\theta=7.$ Plugging into the above equation yields $\cos(7)=\pm \sqrt{\frac{1+\cos(14)}{2}}}.$ Taking the square root of both sides results in $\cos(\theta)=\pm \sqrt{\frac{1+\cos(14)}{2}}$. When you take the inverse cosine, you get $\theta=\arccos (\cos(\theta)).$ Using this relationship, $\boxed{\arccos (\cos 7)=7}.$ The answer is: 7.
