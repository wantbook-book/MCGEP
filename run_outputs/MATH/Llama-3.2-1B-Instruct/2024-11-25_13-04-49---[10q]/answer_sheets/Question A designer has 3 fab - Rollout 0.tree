[U-0: Q: 0.75; N: 1; V: None; UCT: 666] User: A designer has 3 fabric colors he may use for a dress: red, green, and blue. Four different patterns are available for the dress. If each dress design requires exactly one color and one pattern, how many different dress designs are possible?
                                        Ground truth: 12
----[TS-1: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: For the first design, there are 3 options (colors).
----[TS-2: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: There are three options for the fabric color, so there are $\boxed{3}$ choices.
----[TS-3: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: There are 3 choices of colors and 4 choices of patterns, so the total number of different dresses is calculated by multiplying the number of colors and the number of patterns: $3\times 4=12$.
----[[(T) DA-4: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.81; UCT: 999]] Ans: Let's think step by step. Each dress design requires exactly one color and one pattern. Since there are 3 choices for colors and 4 choices for patterns, the total number of dress designs is $3\times4=12$. Therefore, there are $\boxed{12}$ different dress designs possible. The answer is: 12.
----[SQ-5: Q: 0.75; N: 1; V: 1.0; UCT: 0.75] Q: What is the total number of choices the designer has for selecting colors and patterns?
                                             A: The total number of choices is $3 \times 4 = 12$. The answer is $3 \times 4 = 12$.

----------------[TS-21: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: To find the total number of dresses possible, we multiply the number of choices for color and the number of choices for pattern.
----------------[TS-22: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: To calculate the number of distinct dress designs, multiply the number of color options by the number of pattern options: $3\times 4=12$.
----------------[TS-23: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: To find the total number of distinct dresses, multiply the number of options for each attribute together. Thus, we get $3\times 4=12$.
----------------[(T) DA-24: Q: 0.75; N: 1; V: 0.75; UCT: 0.75] Ans: Let's think step by step. There are three choices for a color. For every choice of color, there are four choices for a pattern. So, the total number of different dress designs possible is $3\times 4=12$. Therefore, there are $\boxed{12}$ different dress designs possible. The answer is: 12.

--------[TS-11: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: For each of the three colors, there are four options for the pattern, so the number of designs using just the first color is $4\times4=16$.
--------[(T) DA-12: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.72; UCT: 999] Ans: We know that there are 3 options for colors and 4 options for patterns. To find the total number of combinations, we multiply the number of options for colors by the number of options for patterns: $3\times 4=12$. Therefore, there are $\boxed{12}$ different dress designs. The answer is: 12.

--------[SQ-15: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.6; UCT: 999] Q: Let C denote the set of colors and P denote the set of patterns. Then what is the order (or size) of set C multiplied by the order (or size) of set P?
                                                A: The sizes are $3 \times 4=12$. The answer is $12$.
--------[RS-16: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.7; UCT: 999] Re-Ans: Let's think step by step. There are 3 options for colors and 4 options for patterns. To find the total number of choices, we multiply the number of color options by the number of pattern options: $3\cdot4=12$. Therefore, the designer has $\boxed{12}$ choices for selecting colors and patterns. The answer is: 12.
