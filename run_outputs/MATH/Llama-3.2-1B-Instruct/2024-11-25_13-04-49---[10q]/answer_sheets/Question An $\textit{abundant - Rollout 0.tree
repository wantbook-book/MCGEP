[U-0: Q: 0.12; N: 1; V: None; UCT: 666] User: An $\textit{abundant number}$ is a positive integer, the sum of whose distinct proper factors is greater than the number. (The $\textit{proper factors}$ of a number are all of its factors except the number itself.) How many numbers less than 25 are abundant numbers?

----[TS-1: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: Let's first define what an abundant number is. A number is abundant if the sum of its distinct proper factors is greater than the number itself.
----[TS-2: Q: 0.12; N: 1; V: None; UCT: 0.12] OST: A number $N$ is abundant if it has more proper factors than divisors of $N$.
--------[TS-9: Q: 0.12; N: 1; V: None; UCT: 0.12] OST: To check if a number is abundant, we need to find all of its proper factors.
------------[TS-13: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: For example, the proper factors of 10 are 1, 2, and 5.
------------[TS-14: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: Let's start with the smallest prime number, 2, and list out all the proper factors of each number less than 25 until we reach a pattern or determine how many abundant numbers exist.
------------[TS-15: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: Let's consider each number one by one. For $N=1$, we cannot form any proper factors. For $N=2$, we cannot form any proper factors either. For $N=3$, we can form the factors $1,3$; thus, the sum of them is not greater than the number. However, $N=4$ has no proper factors; therefore, it cannot be abundant. Similarly, $N=5$, $N=7$, and $N=9$ are not abundant as well. Thus, we don't need to check further as we've already found four numbers less than 25 that meet the criteria.
------------[[(T) DA-16: Q: 0.12; N: 1; V: 0.12; UCT: 0.12]] Ans: First, let's list out all of the proper factors of each number less than 25 and see how many numbers are abundant. The proper factors of 1 are none. The proper factors of 2 are 1. The proper factors of 3 are 1. The proper factors of 4 are 1, 2. The proper factors of 5 are 1. The proper factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3. The proper factors of 7 are 1. The proper factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4. The proper factors of 9 are 1, 3. The proper factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5. The proper factors of 11 are 1. The proper factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. The proper factors of 13 are 1. The proper factors of 14 are 1, 2, 7. The proper factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5. The proper factors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8. The proper factors of 17 are 1. The proper factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18. The proper factors of 19 are 1. The proper factors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10. The proper factors of 21 are 1, 3, 7. The proper factors of 22 are 1, 2, 11. The proper factors of 23 are 1. The proper factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. After checking, we find that 9, 12, 18, and 24 are abundant numbers. These numbers have more proper factors than divisors of themselves. Therefore, there are four abundant numbers less than 25.

The answer is: \boxed{4}.
--------[TS-10: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: If $N=p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ where each $p_i$ is prime, then the proper divisors of $N$ are of the form $p_j^{b_j}, j=1,\ldots,k.$
--------[TS-11: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: The proper factors of any divisor of $N$ can be combined to form other proper factors. For example, for the number $15$, the proper factors are $1,3,5,$ and $15$, which when combined yield $1+3+5+15=24.$
--------[(T) DA-12: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.16; UCT: 999] Ans: To determine how many abundant numbers exist below 25, let's analyze each possible value under 25 for $N$: $N=1$, no proper factors; $N=2$, one proper factor (1); $N=3$, one proper factor (1); $N=4$, two proper factors (1, 2); $N=5$, one proper factor (1); $N=6$, two proper factors (1, 2, 3); $N=7$, one proper factor (1); $N=8$, two proper factors (1, 2, 4); $N=9$, one proper factor (1); $N=10$, three proper factors (1, 2, 5); $N=11$, one proper factor (1); $N=12$, two proper factors (1, 2, 3, 4); $N=13$, one proper factor (1); $N=14$, three proper factors (1, 2, 7); $N=15$, one proper factor (1); $N=16$, four proper factors (1, 2, 4, 8); $N=17$, one proper factor (1); $N=18$, three proper factors (1, 2, 9); $N=19$, one proper factor (1); $N=20$, four proper factors (1, 2, 4, 5, 10); $N=21$, one proper factor (1); $N=22$, three proper factors (1, 2, 11); $N=23$, one proper factor (1); $N=24$, four proper factors (1, 2, 3, 8, 12). From our analysis above, the numbers less than 25 that have more proper factors than divisors are $12, 18,$ and $24$. Thus, there are $\boxed{3}$ such numbers. The answer is: 3.
----[TS-3: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: A set of factors is the product of each distinct integers you find, such as the prime factorization of a large number. A good starting point for our analysis could be looking at just the numbers under 25 since finding the sum of their unique factors would get us stuck trying too big.
----[(T) DA-4: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.22; UCT: 999] Ans: First, let's list the abundant numbers below 25: $6,12,18,$ and $24$. Now, let's consider each number individually:

*   For 6, the proper factors are 1 and 6; their sum is 7, so it's not abundant.
*   For 12, the proper factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12; their sum is 28, so it's not abundant.
*   For 18, the proper factors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18; their sum is 39, so it's not abundant.
*   For 24, the proper factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24; their sum is 60, so it's abundant.

Therefore, out of the ten numbers less than 25, four are abundant numbers. Therefore, the answer is: $\boxed{4}$. The answer is: 4.
