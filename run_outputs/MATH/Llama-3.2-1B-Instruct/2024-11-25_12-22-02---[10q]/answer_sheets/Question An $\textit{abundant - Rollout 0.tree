[U-0: Q: 0.19; N: 1; V: None; UCT: 666] User: An $\textit{abundant number}$ is a positive integer, the sum of whose distinct proper factors is greater than the number. (The $\textit{proper factors}$ of a number are all of its factors except the number itself.) How many numbers less than 25 are abundant numbers?
                                        Ground truth: 4
----[TS-1: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: A number is abundant if the sum of its distinct proper factors is greater than the number itself.
----[TS-2: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: A number less than 25 is $\left\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24\right\}$.
----[TS-3: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: A number $N= pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers.
----[[(T) DA-4: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.19; UCT: 999]] Ans: To solve this problem, let's first list out the numbers less than 25 and their respective sums of proper factors:

*   1: 0
*   2: 1
*   3: 1
*   4: 1 + 2 = 3
*   5: 1
*   6: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
*   7: 1
*   8: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7
*   9: 1 + 3 = 4
*   10: 1 + 2 + 5 = 8
*   11: 1
*   12: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16
*   13: 1
*   14: 1 + 2 + 7 = 10
*   15: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
*   16: 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15
*   17: 1
*   18: 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 = 21
*   19: 1
*   20: 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 22
*   21: 1 + 3 + 7 = 11
*   22: 1 + 2 + 11 = 14
*   23: 1
*   24: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 36

Based on these calculations, the following numbers less than 25 are abundant numbers:

*   12
*   18
*   20
*   24

There are four abundant numbers less than 25. Therefore, the answer is: $\boxed{4}$
----[SQ-5: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.7; UCT: 999] Q: What is an example of an abundant number less than 25?
                                           A: One such number is 12 since its proper factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12, and their sum is 28 which is greater than 12. The answer is 12.
----[SQ-6: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.1; UCT: 999] Q: What is an abundant number when reduced to its simplest form?
                                           A: A number $N$ is abundant if the sum of the proper factors of N > N. To determine if a number is abundant, we need to factorize the number into primes and count the total amount of distinct prime factors.
----[SQ-7: Q: 0.19; N: 1; V: 0.2; UCT: 0.19] Q: List the proper factors for each number from 1 through 24 and identify which ones are abundant numbers.
                                             A: Here are the proper factors and their sums:
--------[TS-9: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: A number $N$ is abundant if and only if the sum of its proper factors is greater than $N$.
--------[TS-10: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: Consider each positive integer $n$ less than 25.
--------[TS-11: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: To identify abundant numbers, we need to find the sum of distinct proper factors for each number less than 25.
--------[(T) DA-12: Q: 0.19; N: 1; V: 0.19; UCT: 0.19] Ans: We will consider each number from 1 through 24 and determine whether it is an abundant number.
1. 1: None
2. 2: None
3. 3: None
4. 4: None
5. 5: None
6. 6: 1+2=3
7. 7: None
8. 8: 1+2+4=7
9. 9: 1+3=4
10. 10: 1+2+5=8
11. 11: None
12. 12: 1+2+3+4+6=16
13. 13: None
14. 14: 1+2+7=10
15. 15: 1+3+5=9
16. 16: 1+2+4+8=15
17. 17: None
18. 18: 1+2+3+6+9=21
19. 19: None
20. 20: 1+2+4+5+10=22
21. 21: 1+3+7=11
22. 22: 1+2+11=14
23. 23: None
24. 24: 1+2+3+4+6+8+12=36
We see that 24 is an abundant number because the sum of its distinct proper factors is 36, which is greater than the number itself. Therefore, there are $\boxed{4}$ numbers less than 25 that are abundant numbers. The answer is: 4.
