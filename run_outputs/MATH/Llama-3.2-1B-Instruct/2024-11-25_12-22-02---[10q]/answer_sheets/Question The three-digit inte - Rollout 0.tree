[U-0: Q: 0.16; N: 1; V: None; UCT: 666] User: The three-digit integer $63\underline{\hphantom{0}}$ is a multiple of 3. What is the greatest possible difference between two of the possibilities for the units digit?
                                        Ground truth: 9
----[TS-1: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: A number is a multiple of 3 if the sum of its digits is also a multiple of 3.
----[TS-2: Q: 0.16; N: 1; V: None; UCT: 0.16] OST: A number is a multiple of 3 if it is equal to one of the following forms: $3k$, $3k+1$, or $3k+2$ for some integer $k$.
--------[TS-9: Q: 0.16; N: 1; V: None; UCT: 0.16] OST: We know that the units digit can range from 0 through 9.
------------[TS-13: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: For each value of the units digit, we calculate how close it is to being part of the form $3k$, $3k+1$, or $3k+2$ using modular arithmetic.
------------[TS-14: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: Let us consider each possibility separately. If the units digit is less than 3, then the number must be congruent to 1 modulo 3.
------------[TS-15: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: To maximize the difference between two possible values for the units digit, we need to select a value for the middle term ($\underline{\hphantom{0}}$) that maximizes the largest difference between the other two terms when added to or subtracted from the first term.
------------[[(T) DA-16: Q: 0.16; N: 1; V: 0.16; UCT: 0.16]] Ans: We need to find the differences between $60$ and all possible unit digits of $63\underline{\hphantom{0}}$. If the units digit is $0$, the number is $630$; if it is $3$, the number is $633$; if it is $6$, the number is $636$; if it is $9$, the number is $639$. The greatest difference between these five numbers is $639 - 630=9$. Therefore, the greatest possible difference between two of the possibilities for the units digit is $\boxed{9}$. The answer is: 9.
--------[TS-10: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: Now, let's look at the first few multiples of 3: $3\cdot0=0$, $3\cdot1=3$, $3\cdot2=6$, $3\cdot3=9$, $3\cdot4=12$, and so on.
--------[TS-11: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: For the unit's place to be as large as possible, the largest digits available would be 9.
--------[(T) DA-12: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.16; UCT: 999] Ans: First, let's list out all the multiples of 3 between 60 and 75. These are 63, 66, and 69. Now, consider the differences between each pair of these multiples:

$|63 - 66| = |3|$\\
$|63 - 69| = |-6|$\\
$|66 - 69| = |-3|$\\

We see that $|-6| > |-3| > |3|$. Therefore, the greatest possible difference is 6, and the answer is: $\boxed{6}$. The answer is: 6.
----[TS-3: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: None; UCT: 999] OST: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is also divisible by 3. For our number $63\underline{\hphantom{0}}$, the sum of the first two digits is $6+3=9$, so it is already divisible by 3.
----[(T) DA-4: Q: 0.0; N: 0; V: 0.19; UCT: 999] Ans: To determine whether a three-digit number is a multiple of 3, add its digits together. If the result is a multiple of 3, then so is the original number. If not, try different values for the units digit until it satisfies this condition. A number is a multiple of 3 if the sum of its digits is also a multiple of 3. We need to try $4$, $7$, and $10$ as the units digit. When the units digit is $4$, the sum of the digits is $6$, which is a multiple of 3. So, one possibility is $\underline{4}\underline{0}\underline{3}=403$. When the units digit is $7$, the sum of the digits is $9$, which is a multiple of 3. So, another possibility is $\underline{7}\underline{0}\underline{3}=703$. When the units digit is $10$, the sum of the digits is $13$, which is not a multiple of 3. Therefore, the greatest possible difference between two of the possibilities for the units digit is $7-4=3$. The answer is: 3.

                                           A: The sum of the digits is $6+3=9$. The answer is 9.

                                           A: In order for $63\underline{\hphantom{0}}$ to be a multiple of 3, its units digit must be either 0 or 3. The answer are 0 and 3.
